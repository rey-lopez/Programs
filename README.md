# Programs
Base code for program assignments in Software Development (C S 371). 

Includes placeholders for questions for Program 1 and Program 2, as well as a simple Hello World program. The remainder of the contents are for future programs:

## Program 1 and Program 2
These assignments rely on the SimpleWebServer program. Each gets graded using tags in a cloned repository. 
Program 2 is incomplete. I was able to get it to serve the different image types as well as the favicon and have a second html file that contained an image however I could not get the ant file to run out of www. 

## Program 3
This assignment relies on the Coverage programs. 

## Program 4
This assignment relies on the Circles programs. 

(Forked repo for @rey-lopez.)
